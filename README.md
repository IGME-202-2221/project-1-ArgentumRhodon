## Your Additions

1. I made all art for the game.
2. I only managed to make 2 different types of enemies, but I think they're nice.
7. The main thing that will differentiate this game from the others is the unique style of the art.

## Sources

-All me.

## Known Issues

There might be some errors with collision and object deletion that I haven't run into yet, but I think I've added anough guard clauses to prevent that.

### Requirements not completed
Pretty sure they're all met.
